### Features left to implement

A questioner should be able to add custom options.
Display on the players personal screen if they answered correctly or not, add the happy and sad illustrations.
Find player by ID and not their name, this can have issues.
A player should get more points for answering faster.
Display the time taken to answer the question.
A question needs to have a decoy count so true/false questions can be added.
When creating a room a set number of rounds needs to be selected.
